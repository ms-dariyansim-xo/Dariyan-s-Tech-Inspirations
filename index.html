<body>
    <p>Being born in the 90s, I have witnessed such a cool evolution of many game consoles between late 90s to early 2000s.
        As a kid, I had an obsession of places with arcade games, especially the one with Dance Dance Revolution machine. 
    <p>Needless to say, dance was one of my hobbies growing up-- so most of my gaming experiences included anything-dance.
        We're talking a range of style from DDR machine to the one where you could play DDR at home with a dance mat.
    There was a Hip-Hop option on "DANCE CENTRAL" by XBOX that I loved, not to mention "JUST DANCE" on Wii with.</p>
    <p>I think that's why I'm pretty fascinated with  Virtual and Augmented Reality devices in ways that they operate.
